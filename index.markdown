homePageDescription:  This blog is for anyone interested in technology. I plan to post writeups of issues I have encountered while learning something new with the solution. Other stuff you might expect to find in my blog is any resources from the classes I teach as well as programming challenges that aim to get you curious about programming so you can get more interested in the dev field.
