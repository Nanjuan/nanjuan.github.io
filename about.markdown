I am currently working as an Application Security Engineer. Some of my duties are to help companies and developers secure applications by performing penetration testing of their applications and managing their source code vulnerability scanners. I am passionate about helping my clients secure their applications to ensure they can operate with minimal downtime. 

Some of my hobbies include helping students and individuals interested in joining the information security field get their goal of joining the field by giving them labs and guidance to get to entry-level positions. 

In my free time, I like to build lab environments to try and test new operating systems, tools, and applications I find online. Another thing I find fun and interesting is designing networks as well as participating in CTF and other online challenges.
