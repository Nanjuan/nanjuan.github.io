As a passionate advocate for efficient cybersecurity practices, I am thrilled to introduce my latest project - a dedicated repository of Snyk automation scripts tailored for enterprise environments. Snyk, as many of you might know, is a powerful tool that helps identify and fix vulnerabilities in code and dependencies. While it offers incredible out-of-the-box features, I believe that automation can significantly enhance its capabilities, especially in complex enterprise settings. In this blog, we will delve into the nuances of these scripts. Join me as we embark on this journey to make cybersecurity more efficient and robust with the power of automation!TopPrerequisites Configuration Setup Instructions File Rename:Rename the config-template.py to config.py. Adding Credentials:Inside config.py, you’ll need to add your groupId, sourceOrgId, and Authorization tokens. groupId:This is your group ID value. To find it: Navigate to your main group. Look at the URL: https://app.snyk.io/group/{groupId}. The {groupId} portion is your value. sourceOrgId:This represents the organization you’ll use to clone all the configurations. It’s a best practice when setting up Snyk to have a default organization with all your configurations in one place, making it easier to clone configurations to other organizations. Go to the settings of your default organization. Locate the “organization id”. This will be the value for sourceOrgId in your config.py file. Authorization Token: Navigate to the bottom left side of the screen and click on your account. Choose ‘Account Settings’. Under ‘API Token’, click ‘click to show’. This reveals the token, which you’ll use as the Authorization in your config.py file. TopCreateNewOrg.pyThis script will take a list of organization names from a .csv file with one organization per line, as shown in the example file organization-names.csv. The script will then create new organizations in the group selected in the config file. For configuration details, refer to the config file section.One thing to note: This API endpoint will be replaced with a REST API. I will update the script once the update is released. If there is interest and if this comment is still here, the new endpoint hasn’t been released, and I haven’t updated the script.TopgetOrgList.pyThis script will retrieve a list of all your organizations from your Snyk portal along with the slug for each organization. It will then create a .csv file with each entry on a separate line. This is useful for integrating Snyk with AD for custom role mapping, especially when adding new developers to SSO. This ensures they are automatically added to specific applications.

Streamers use the Stream Deck to make repetitive actions like turning the mic on and off to record a clip while they stream easily. I realized that I could simply use automation and invoke these scripts from the stream deck to increase my productivity and automate mundane actions like opening different chromes pages from different profiles. I also plan to use this document as a live document where I can keep adding automation scripts I add to my Stream Deck.TopPrerequisites Some prerequisites to keep in mind if you planning to follow this tutorial. I am using Mac OS 11.6 at the time of writing this tutorial. For Chrome, I am using the laters version in November 2021. Also, I am using Mac OS Automator software. Also, if I see a lot of interest in this post, I might work on Windows version for this tutorial.TopHow to open Chrome with different Profiles/Accounts on the Stream Deck.The following step will help you create the necessary Automator scripts to open different chrome windows with other accounts from your computer. Open the Automator program and click New Document if prompt. Then select application and click choose. Search on the left upper search bar for Run Shell Script and drag that actions to the right window. On the Run Shell Script windows, enter the following command line. This line will open Chrome and with the profile set as one in a new chrome window. By increasing the number and pressing Run on the Automator top right corner, you can test the code to verify you are able to open the correct browser profile you are trying to add for automation. /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\\ chrome --profile-directory=\"Profile 1\" After you are able to test and run the correct profile got to File and click save. On the windows that open, name the Automation program as you which and make sure the File Format is set to Application and click save. To test the script, just find where it is saved and click it like any other application to see if it opens Chrome with the correct profile. To choose a different profile, perform the same steps on the group, change the Profile 1 to Profile 2, and keep increasing the number depending on how many profiles you have on your Chrome Browser. TopHow to Add Metasploit to Elgato Stream Deck.The following steps will show you how to add Metasploit to Elgato Stream Deck. pre-requirement make sure you have Metasploit installed and you are able to run it from the command line. Open the Elgato Stream Deck software and search for Multi Action on the right search bar and drag to one of the empty fiels. Enter the name you desire on the title section and on Content click on Content section the little arrow icon. Then add the follwing step to the Multi Action. System: Open System: Text Stream Deck: Delay System: Text Stream Deck: Delay System: Text On the System: Option select the terminal application to open. On the first System: Text enter the title you want to use to identify this step then enter the command line to start the Metasploit databse my example is below and check the box that said. Press Enter After messages /opt/metasploit-framework/bin/msfdb start On the two Stream Deck: Delay add 2000 ms On the second System: Text enter the title you want to use to identify this step then enter the command line to answer the question from starting msfdb. On the last System: Text enter the title you want to use to identify this step then enter the command line to start msfconsole. * Remember you will need to enter you password for sudo sudo /opt/metasploit-framework/bin/msfconsole I added another I con use to stop the msfdb after you are done with Metasploit. For this you will aldo need a Multi Action and add the fallowing functionality. System: Open System: Text On the System: Option select the terminal application to open. On the first System: Text enter the title you want to use to identify this step then enter the command line to stop the database. /opt/metasploit-framework/bin/msfdb stop Last step change your icons to one you want if you want to use the icon I have you can save it from this post as png. icon TopHow to open Burp and other tools with Stream DeckThe following steps will show you how to add Burp and other software to Elgato Stream Deck. Open the Elgato Stream Deck software and search for Open on the right search bar and drag to one of the empty fiels. Click on the Icon on the middle windows and on the options bellow click on Choose then select the app you want to run with that click. Last test the new icon and recreate any of the steps with as many apps as you want too add to the stream deck. TopHow to Add Automation script to Elgato Stream Deck.The following steps will show you how to add Automator scripts to Elgato Stream Deck. Open the Elgato Stream Deck software and search for open on the right search bar. Drag the open icon on the Stream Deck software to an empty window. Click on the icon on the middle window, enter your title, click choose, and select the application you want to run when clicking on the Stream Deck. I recommend creating a folder with your Icons and logos you might want to use for the icon. Remember to try different sizes to get a good result on the Stream Deck. This is how I have my icons organized. Remember, the icon might not look fine, so you might need to try a different resolution on the Stream Deck to make it look correct.

Any extra device that was mounted needs to be remove too. First make sure the VM is power off. On VMware right click on the VM you want to convert and click on setting. Then make sure that CD/DVD (IDE) is set to Auto detect. Then make sure that Display is set to Auto detect as well. On Virtualbox go to setting on the top left area of the program. Then go to storage and make sure is empty like the picture bellow. Here as long as you did not change the display setting that should be ok if you did set to default again.Start the Conversion on a linux (Ubuntu,Kali,Other) Terminal First step is to export the machine you want to convert to either VM Formats to conversts vm.ova vm.vmdk Make sure that the VM file you want to converts is on the a Linux machine that have qemu.utils install to make it easier to convert the vm.Make sure qemu-utils are install To make sure you have qemu-img install. open terminal type qemu-img and press enter you should get sometime alone the line of qemu-img: not enought arguments this will let you know that qemu-utils are install on your linux computer otherwise on the same terminal run sudo apt-get update after that is done run sudo apt-get install qemu-utils Next step is to navigates to the folder that have the VM you exported and want to convert. if you have vm.ova follow section 1 otherwise go to section 2Section 1 Here is how to extract a .ova to .vmdk so you can continue on section 2 After navigating to the folder run tar -xvf inputVM.ova the VM.ova would be the name of your vm that you want to covert so that might vary for you VM. This might take a while to decompress depending on the side of the vm. This will give you the .ovf .mf .vmdk that you need to convert now you can move to section 2Section 2 Here is the step to convert .vmdk to .qcow2 First step when you have the VM.vmdk is to run the qemu-img command to convert from .vmdk to .qcom2 Open terminal and navigate to the folder that have the VM.vmdk you want to convert. Then run the command qemu-img convert -O qcow2 inputVM.vmdk outputVM.qcow2. This will take some time depending on the size of the VM and computer processing power.And your done!!!Now you can import this new VM.qcow2 to any KVM Hypervisor like Antsle box and the VM will be read and write and not only read.Well your done!!!! any question email me!!!!!
